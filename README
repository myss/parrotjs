Platforms
=========

PJS should compile on any linux box which contains enough development tools 
(gcc, flex, bison, etc.) I didn't try to compile it in any other platform, 
but it should be doable.

We recommend that you use the last version of Parrot. We tested the current
version of PJS with Parrot 0.5.0


How to build?
=============

- download the parrot source code (see http://www.parrotcode.org/source.html)

- go into parrot_dir/languages/ and do: svn checkout http://parrotjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ parrotjs-read-only

- rename parrotjs to pjs

- add 'pjs' to parrot_dir/config/gen/languages.pm (just add the word 'pjs' next to other languages).

- append two lines to parrot_dir/src/call_list.txt, one containing 'v JOPI' and one containing 'I JOP'

- go to parrot_dir/ and do:
  
    $ perl Configure.pl && make

- go to parrot_dir/languages/pjs/ and do:

    $ make



How to run?
===========

To run a javascript file, go to parrot_dir/languages/pjs/ and do:

    $ ../../parrot pjs.pir myfile.js

If you want to compile to PIR code, do:

    $ ../../parrot pjs.pir -c myfile.js



Testing
=======

You can test PJS by 'make test', but therefore you need the spidermonkey interpreter 
and you need to have it available in your path with the name 'js'.
